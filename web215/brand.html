      	<h2>Brand Guide</h2>
		<br>
		<strong>Concept:</strong> My idea is to help clients to improve records and information management, to support individuals or organizationâ€™s present and future, keeping in mind the regulatory, legal, environmental, and operational requirements.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Mission:</strong> To optimize and support the clients your information, by offering a structure, policies, procedures, and processes necessary to manage all the information stored within an organization.  
        <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Goal:</strong> Help our customers optimize their information and records across their lifecycle.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Slogan:</strong> "Records organized make your life better and simple"
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Colors:</strong> I choose my palette color of the software <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com">http://colorschemedesigner.com</a> 
		It has one main color and four subcolors and I will play with two palletes:orange-coral and greys.
		<br>
		<br>
		These palettes represent our favorite colors Coral and Grey and we will use them as background, letters,links,etc. 
		They symbolize our pesonality and harmony. 
		See Below palette color.
