		<br>

		<b>Something to remember me by:</b> I always have to be doing something, and my friends always call me to know what cultural events are happening or where is a good place to go in Charlotte. I have a philosophy: 
		    Life is so short, you have to work but enjoy life and the moments!
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>I'd also like to share:</b> This class is a real challenge for me. I consider myself a regular technology person, but I hope to improve and learn many things in this class.
